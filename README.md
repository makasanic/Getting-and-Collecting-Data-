# Getting-and-Collecting-Data-
R_Analysis
# Creating one R_script called run_analysis that does the following

#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
# Uses descriptive activity names to name  the activities in the data set
#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
#From the data set in step 4, creates a second,independent tidy data set with the average for each activity an each subject.

#Dowload the file and unzip into working directory
# Unzip dataset to /data directory
#Merging the training and the test setsto create on data set:
#Reading training tables:
#Reading testing tables:
#Reading feature vector:
#Reading activity labels:
#Assigning column names:
#Merging all data in one set:
#Reading column names:
#Create vector for defining ID,mean and standard deviation:
#Making neccesary subset from setAllIn0ne:
#Using descriptive activity names to name the activity in the data set:
#Creating a second ,independent tidy data set with the averageof each variable for each activity and each subject:
#Making second tidy data set
#Writing a second tidy dat set in txt file
